# Hello!

I am Qsionc 🤓
I usually code abominations. 
Usually in abominable C/C++, also trying myself in Rust, Zig, Java and even C3. 
I used to be great C/C++ preacher but recently C bit me so hard in my backside with UB that it left me with sour taste of unwashed you-know-what in my mouth...

Sometimes Python, recently picking up Julia for quick-maths (Please, stop using matlab, its bad and I DO NOT invite anyone to discussion, I will not debate my feelings about matlab, I refuse to change my mind)
