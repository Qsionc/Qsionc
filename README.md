## What am i learning 📖

### C++
I am currently in process of practicing many C+ and uncovering "mysteries" behind it and STL. There is still many little elements i need to learn and practice.
Additionally, i am learning OpenGL, and i will also try to learn Vulkan API to create games.

### Python

I consider myself junior Python programmer and i still want to learn many frameworks this language offers, like Django, Tensorflow, etc.

### Rust

I also consider myself infant in Rust now, but [Tranzystorek](https://github.com/tranzystorek-io) got my back!

### Overall software development

Additionally, im interested in Machine Learning and Numeric Algorithms aswell 

### Future plans

I want to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript and also touch some Java. We will see how this one will go.
