# Hello!

I am Qsionc :nerd_face:
It is nice of you to come and see my creations. Please, leave a comment and share some insight!

## $ whoami :relieved:

I am young integrated circuits developer and i mainly design and make simulations of new Transistor-based technologies for a living on Warsaw University of Technology.<br>
As a hobby (and hopefully, as second job) i am C/C++/Python developer aspiring to, perhaps, be home grown game-dev.

## What am i learning :book:

### C++
I am currently in process of practicing many C+ and uncovering "mysteries" behind it and STL. There is still many little elements i need to learn and practice.
Additionally, i am learning OpenGL, and i will also try to learn Vulkan API to create games.

### Python

I consider myself junior Python programmer and i still want to learn many frameworks this language offers, like Django, Tensorflow, etc.

### Overall software development

Additionally, im interested in Machine Learning and Numeric Algorithms aswell 

### Future plans

I want to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript and also touch some Java. We will see how this one will go.
